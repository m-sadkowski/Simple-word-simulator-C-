# The World Simulation

Welcome to **The World Simulation**, a project that explores the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** through the creation of a virtual ecosystem. This C++ program simulates a living world filled with diverse animals, each possessing unique abilities, and a human character that users can control. The project demonstrates key OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and modularity while providing an interactive experience.

## Key Features

1. **Object-Oriented Design**:
   - The project is built around OOP principles, encapsulating data within objects and enabling interactions through well-defined interfaces.

2. **Virtual Ecosystem**:
   - A simulated environment where various entities (animals, humans) coexist, interact, and influence each other dynamically.

---

## Tasks

Through this project, you will:

1. **Object Modeling**:
   - Learn how to represent real-world entities as objects with attributes and behaviors.

2. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**:
   - Explore how animals inherit traits and exhibit diverse behaviors based on their types.

3. **Encapsulation and Modularity**:
   - Experience the benefits of encapsulation and modularity in organizing code for reusability and maintainability.

4. **User Interaction**:
   - Engage with the simulation by controlling a human character and observing the consequences of your actions.
